Done by: Aleksandar kacanski (Sasha)

Only requirement is to use Python 3, application cattest and to:

Create your own client to access whatever and get data in specific formats to cattest app
Your client can be loosely coupled in cattest application (simple configuration)
Everything runs in dynamic runtime mode, in essence you can select one, many or all
clients and run them in sequence and they all will build corresponding xml feeds
Whatever client pulls from app source will be formatted according to XSD schema to XML
output feed
